## Introduction:

This is a demo application for my portfolio. This application is designed for social workers and welfare organizations to streamline workflow, keep track of and sort applications, and save relevant information. The application uses a Windows Forms .Net interface and connects to a SQL server.

## Workflow

When an application is submitted, the information will be saved to different tables in the database. The application will link to its corresponding applicant and the program it applied to. Applications can then be queried to be worked on based on their shared program link. 

## Features:

### Search Functions:
- Quickly find the program they wish to work on.
- Filter applications and applicants that fit the criteria.
