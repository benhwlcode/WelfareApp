## Introduction:

This is a demo application for my portfolio. This application is designed for social workers and welfare organizations to streamline workflow, keep track of and sort applications, and save relevant information. The application uses a Windows Forms .Net interface and connects to a SQL server.

## Features:

Search Functions:
- A dashboard search function for users to quickly find the program they wish to work on.
- A detailed search filter for users to find the applications and applicants that fit their desired criteria.

Query Constructors:
- An easy-to-use query constructor for users to construct complicated Sql queries without in-depth knowledge of the syntax.

Error Checkers
- Inform users of the specific error.
- Ensures fields are not empty and the inputs are correct.

Applicant Information Retention
- Applicant information is saved for future use.
- Users can auto-fill applications with the information of previous applicants.
- The application will ensure no duplicate applications are submitted.

Real-Time Updates
- User edits are updated in real-time to ensure the accurate information is always displayed.
- Table filters and conditions will always reflect user changes.
